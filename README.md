# MonteCarloMurderMystery-PyGothamTV2020
A Holmes-Watson-PyMC3 adventure!

(The following is intended to be in the style of a movie poster for a 1920’s silent thriller.)

On a beautiful summer’s eve in the coast of Monte Carlo, Count Frick Von Twist is found dead in his luxurious hotel suite on the heels of a dinner party celebrating his 90th birthday. In shock and anguish, his adopted daughter, Viscountess Bae Zhun, calls upon famed detective Shellakybooky Holmes and his trusted associate Jahnvi Watson to deduce her father’s killer.

A meticulous Watson interviews the eleven dinner guests separately and examines the Count’s pet python to find probable cause. Holmes quietly enters his Hamiltonian Mind Castle (HMC) to run simulations of possible versions of the fated evening’s events and derive posterior distributions of the probability of each of the guests’ murderous intent. Together, will they find the Count’s killer with a degree of confidence that would convince a jury? Will Bae Zhun find peace, convergence and justice amidst all the uncertainty? Tune in on October 2nd at 9:30 p.m. EST on PyGotham TV to watch: A Monte Carlo Murder Mystery!*

*A PyMC3 production directed by an ardent pythonista (who might have read one too many detective novels) with a little help from friends!
