    "This past summer, Dr. Jahnvi Watson and I were spending some time in Monte Carlo at the Hotel Hamilton for what you might call \"a vacation\". In truth, I was honing my renowned skills of deduction while Watson went about her activities. I was engaged in becoming familiar with a school of statistical thinking, the Bayesian methodology of inference and analysis. There are remarkable methods within this school that are perfectly suited to my needs as a detective and man of science. Hence I spent many a summer day training my mind palace in the implementation of these methods so as to employ it most effectively whenever the need arose. And as luck would have it, such a need arose! The murder of Count Frick Von Twist provided an ideal testing ground for these methods and I have chronicled the details of the case and the subsequent resolution here.\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case with most explanations, once it is grasped it seems almost trivial, a phenomenon that annoys me immensely! Like a magician's carefully constructed sleight of hand, to reveal one's tricks is to expose oneself to ridicule and trivialization. Nonetheless, upon my friend's insitence, I shall endeavour to provide you with such an explanation with a view to make them seem elementary to you as well. But be not fooled, my dear reader, as the apparent simplicity of these methods bely an underlying sophistication that can only be grasped at with sufficient practice. It is my hope thus that the analysis presented here inspires many an amateur enthusiast of the science of deduction (such as my dear friend Watson herself) to embrace these marvelous methods whenever they are in need of infering information from data.

    "Watson's meticulous compilation of the above data sets us up very well indeed to be able to tackle the problem. What can we glean from a table of 0's and 1's? Well for one, we can already see the variance in the number of ones in some of the rows (i.e., between the different suspects). However, to approach this more rigorously, I propose a model belonging to the group of models known as Rasch model (or an [Item Response Model](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_20/stan-users-guide/item-response-models-section.html)).\n",

Simply put, the higher the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for a particular suspect-proxy (j,k) pair, the greater the odds of their culpability within that context."

Besides, it is early in this game of cat and mouse and so I am going to set those numbers aside for now and instead consider the same prior for each suspect - a normal distribution centred on 0 and with a standard deviation of 1.
